To get the most out of Yon, it's important to understand how you can use release names to improve the usability of your repositories. 
Yon categorizes and sorts your releases based on their names.

## Name Template Grammar
Release name templates consist of property names surrounded by curly brackets, generally in the form of `{Property}text-that-doesn't-change-between-releases{Another Property}`. 
A more realistic example of this would be if you had a game named _Falling Squares_ that used [Semantic Versioning]() to version its releases. 
Your release name template may look something like `Falling Braces v{Major Version Number}.{Minor Version Number}`.
